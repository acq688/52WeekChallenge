The only source of light to touch this section of cave, a small pinprick that had shown on a single 
doubloon for centuries, went out. Dust and pebbles filled the already musty tunnel as the tip of a 
pickax widened the hole until a head could, and did, fit through.

He was a young man, as the thin whiskers on his chin betrayed, but thin and short. That was why he 
had been chosen, he was the only one small enough to reach the inner chamber, but able to deal with 
what waited for him there. Over the course of several hours he widened the hole until he could just 
barely fit his slight frame through. Once he tumbled through he reached back for a pack from which he 
extracted a torch, though it looked like a club in his diminutive hands. After lighting the torch he pulled 
one last item from the pack before shouldering it, a plate of metal. Impossibly smooth with a slight 
curve, it might have been mistaken for a scale fallen from a city guards armor were it not ten times the 
size and a brilliant hue of green. 

Having shouldered his burden he looked back the way he had came once more before girding his 
nerves and moving deeper into the cave, torch in one hand and metal slab held forth in the other like a 
talisman. He wandered the caves for many hours, often finding himself at dead ends but always 
finding his way by following an ever increasing trail of treasure. Anyone stumbling upon the place 
would no doubt fill their pockets, thinking to come back later with a mule,  but he had been warned 
"Touch NOTHING." the Elders had said a thousand times. "No matter how inconsequential it may seem 
touch NOTHING but stone, even to tread on it."

That might have been difficult considering the now heaping mounds of gold, silver, gems, even 
paintings and statues that littered his way like poisonous plants, but the tunnels widened as he went, 
until they were large enough to fit whole buildings.

Not long after lighting his third torch the slim boy walked into a vast, cavernous room. Though his torch 
did not provide enough light for him to know, it was large enough to contain his whole village many 
times over. He could see however that the treasures became even denser here. Heaping mounds of 
the stuff surrounded him, often overflowing into each other so that he must turn around and find 
another way.

He went as deeply as he though prudent, seeing no way around a massive mountain of goods in front 
of him he stepped back several paces and stood there breathing heavily. He finally steeled himself, 
thrust the green disk before him and in what he had intended as an authoritative statement, but left 
his mouth as a timid question said "Erinna?"

The mountain of wealth before him seemed to explode as something burst from the depths of it. It 
was all he could do to stand there frozen with his eyes closed and the metal thrust out in from of him 
like a shield, rather than curl up into a ball and cry as the huge serpent sprang from its costly bed. 
When the great head whipped about on him and let loose its roar he nearly collapsed, but managed to 
stay standing  with the plate in front of him, though he shook like the last autumn leaf in a pitched 
storm.

Though to him it seemed like it would never end, the roar did subside. He stood there shaking for 
several minutes before he dared to open his eyes again, only to find a great catlike eye staring back at 
him, no more than 20 feet away and nearly twice his height. The eye looked him up and down for 
several minutes, on occasion blinking its huge lid, causing a small breeze to wash over the already 
trembling boy.

After what seemed like ages  a deep booming voice spook, with the strangeness of lilt that a foreigner 
might have, but with a perfect grammar.

"What. Do You Seek."

It was nearly a minute before he stammered out a reply, but the beast did not press as it waited, only 
watched.

"To Ss...save my village from the great plague which is..."

A deep breath from the dragon stopped his speech and drew his cloths against him as if in a great 
wind.

"What Do. You offer."

"My serviiiitude."

Some yards away a light bloomed, spewing from the things mouth as it let out a hideous rasp that 
seemed to pass for its laugh.

"What need. Have I for one Weaker than Myself."
The child froze. He had dreaded this question. Time and again he was cautioned not to lie to this 
creature, that it would know instantly, but looking at it now there was nothing he could claim in 
truthfulness that he could do which it could not. Though he felt the wyrm had a patience born of many 
eons the question loomed, crushing him with its weight. His mind raced, his body screamed at him to 
run, but he knew that was certain death. He had to say something, anything that was true. Before he 
knew it his mouth was moving on its own, speaking the words that would seal the fate of millions.

"I can fit places that you can't."

The eye watched him, unblinking. STUPID! As if a dragon needed him to crawl under it's house and kill 
rats like the pub owner did. He began to shake even harder, the things in his pack clanking against each 
other as he shook with the violence of one in a fit.

Erinna's eye disappeared from in front of him, and her great bulk could be heard moving about in the 
great piles, the crash and tumble of priceless things against stone along with the dull rasp of scales 
over stone and gem.

Some part of our slender minor demanded that he run for the tunnels, make his way out, village be 
damned. But he knew he would never make it out before Erinna was on him, and then death was 
certain. He waited.

After what seemed like half the day she returned. His torch had long since gone out, and his arm had 
long since tired of holding the heavy dragon scale in front of him, but he dared not light another torch 
or let it down for even a moment, to be seen by a dragon without presenting an Oath Scale was death.

Her front-most claw was clutching something, but he could not see what it was.

"My time in this. world is done, but My Tasks are Not." Her great skull loomed, illuminated by a flame 
in her mouth, nearly thrice the size of his house.

"I will save Your. village, and in Exchange You will Bring this Item to whoever Advises the one who 
leads the land once known as Villman." She extended her talon, but did not show its contents.

"You will Give It. only to that Advisor and will do as He Says. You will Show it to No other living Being. Is 
it So Agreed?"

A delivery? What could be so valuable to warrant this trade, but that a dragon would not keep for itself 
in its great greed? Why would she not deliver it herself, surely with her great magical power she could 
just make the thing appear in front of the advisor? He had many questions, but he had been warned, 
he was there to answer, not to ask.

"It is So Agreed."

The serpents tongue, so fast it was barely visible, snapped out and ripped the scale from his hand, 
leaving something cold and heavy in its place. The light of the dragons flame was suddenly gone, and 
though he could no longer see he knew the room was filled with dust as it clogged his nose and throat, 
making him cough and sneeze. He slowly drew another torch from his pack and lit it awkwardly, not 
daring to let go of whatever he held in his hand, lest it become lost in the cache that surrounded him.

The first thing he noticed when the torch was aflame was what he held. It was a small statue, about 
the thickness of a swords pommel. It was roughly carved, but clearly depicted a woman, great with 
child, bearing a large tankard. What was such a crude piece doing in the hoard of a dragon, meticulous 
in their curation?

This thought was lost when Derry noticed that the horde and it's guardian were gone. He was now the 
only thing in this cavern as far as the eye could see. He took a moment to orient himself then made for 
the tunnels that had brought him in, feeling exposed in the center of this great room, though he was 
strangely certain that Erinna was gone.

Once he was back to the relative confinement of the caves his pace slowed, but had a bounce to it. He 
could not believe his good fortune, to save his village at the cost of only a conveyance of goods? He 
smiled at his good fortune as he wrapped the statue in cloth and tucked it into his pack.

Had anyone else seen him they would have commented on the dumb smile across his face. Who else 
but a fool could think themselves lucky to make a delivery even a dragon could not?
