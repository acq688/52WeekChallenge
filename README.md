This is a writing challenge. 
You can see the prompts here:

RULES:
1. Starts the week of October 1st (to be due on the 8th!), 
   but we'll probably be taking November off.

2. You don't have to participate every week, but we'll be sad if you don't.

3. Your story can't be 1,667 words, because then everyone will hate you.
    (You Nanos out there know where this number came from...)

4. No personal insults (i.e. Ryan's story is homoerotic, therefore he is gay.)

5. You must comment on everyone's story. 
    -Say one good thing and one negative thing. None of this "It was good."

6. You can work no more than 1 week ahead (but if you don't open the pr, I'll never know)

7. You will submit your stories in the form of prs. (pull requests)
