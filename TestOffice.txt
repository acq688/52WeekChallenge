This is another sample I’m trying to figure out how to get word wrapping to work on an export from Microsoft Office. Of course I’m running 2007, so newer/older editions may have more options. Or different steps. I don’t even know. I just don’t.

So let’s talk about getting your git set up on ye olde PC. 
1. First, go to http://github.com . Make a free account. 
2. Go to the repo link and hit fork (it’s on the upper left side). You’ve now forked the repo!
3. Now, go here:  http://windows.github.com/ and download the installer. It’s only 37 MB…if you’re watching your space.
4. Login. You’ll have to tell it  your name and email.
5. You should be able to see the repo that you’ve forked “acq688/52WeekChallenge” when you click on your name. Go ahead and click the “Clone” link. 
6. Once it loads, you should be able to see my information with all of the commits. If you click on Tools, and then “open Explorer”, you can see everything in a normal Windows explorer. Go ahead and do this.
7. Drag and drop your story into the proper week. So, put your eldritch adventure into Week1. Make sure that it’s in a good file format, like I discussed in the other sample pull requests.
8. Your Github GUI says “Uncommitted Changes” now. Click on Show.
9. Is your story formatted well? Does everything look ok? If so, go ahead and write a commit message. Like, for example, “Amanda’s Week 1 Story”. When you’re done, click commit.
10. Notice that your new commit isn’t synced. Go ahead and click the sync button. 
11. This will add your file up to github. Unless you changed branches, it should be in your “master” branch. Go ahead and open a pull request and send it towards my master. Everyone will be able to see and comment it there.
